# Player-Performance-Prediction-In-Cricket
This project aims to predict the performance of cricket players, both batsmen and bowlers, using various machine learning techniques. The performance prediction models have been implemented using Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The datasets used for training and testing the models are "most_runs_2022.csv" for batsmen and "most_wickets_2022.csv" for bowlers.

# Dataset Description
--> most_runs_2022.csv: This dataset contains the batting performance data of cricket players appeared in the IPL 15 or TATA IPL 2022. It includes features such as batting average, highest score, average strike rate, number of matches played, centuries, half-centuries, fours, sixes, not outs, balls faced, and years of experience.

--> most_wickets_2022.csv: This dataset contains the bowling performance data of cricket players appeared in the IPL 15 or TATA IPL 2022. It includes features such as bowling average, economy rate, number of wickets taken, five-wicket hauls, ten-wicket hauls, matches played, balls bowled, and years of experience.

# Instructions to Run
To run the prediction models, execute the respective Python scripts for batsmen and bowlers using any Python environment or IDE. Make sure to have the required libraries installed, such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for ANN, CNN, and RNN), and any additional libraries specified in the scripts.

# Results
The performance of each prediction model will be evaluated and displayed after running the respective Python scripts. The metrics used for evaluation may vary based on the model used (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, R-squared score, etc.).

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of various machine learning techniques to predict the performance of cricket players. By comparing the results of different models, we can identify the most suitable approach for predicting the performance of batsmen and bowlers accurately.

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to contact the project owner or open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.
